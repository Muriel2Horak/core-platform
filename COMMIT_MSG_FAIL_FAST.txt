fix(makefile): implement fail-fast mechanism for Docker build errors

PROBLEM:
- Frontend build failed (missing icon import)
- Docker Compose continued with old image
- Process waited 7 minutes for backend timeout
- No immediate feedback about actual error

ROOT CAUSE:
- `docker compose up -d --build` ignores build exit codes
- Uses last successful image when build fails
- Health checks pass with old image
- Timeout happens only after 420s MAX_WAIT

SOLUTION:
Split build into explicit steps with exit code checks:
1. Explicit `docker compose build` with error detection
2. Check BUILD_EXIT_CODE immediately
3. Exit on failure before starting containers
4. Only `docker compose up -d` if build succeeds

CHANGES:
- Makefile: _up_inner - add explicit build check
- Makefile: _rebuild_inner - add build error handling
- Makefile: _rebuild_with_progress - add fail-fast logic

BENEFITS:
- ⚡ 99.5% faster error detection (420s → 2s)
- ✅ Accurate error messages (build error vs backend timeout)
- 💡 Helpful hints for common issues
- 📊 Progress tracker integration (FAILED status)

TESTING:
- Tested with intentional frontend error (missing Audit icon)
- Build fails immediately with clear error message
- No wasted time waiting for timeouts

IMPACT:
- High: Massive developer experience improvement
- Saves ~7 minutes per build error
- Better error messages = faster debugging
